# Titan Campus Algorithmic Assistant (TCAA)

The Titan Campus Algorithmic Assistant (TCAA) is a comprehensive, hands-on final project designed to integrate the full range of algorithmic and data-structure concepts covered in CPSC 335. You will apply your knowledge by building a fully interactive Python GUI application that performs real-world problem solving across graph algorithms, dynamic programming, greedy strategies, and advanced string-matching algorithms. This project reinforces theoretical understanding through practical implementation while strengthening the your ability to design, analyze, and present algorithmic solutions.

## Instructions
1. Run 'main.py'
2. Select a module to begin (Campus Navigator, Study Planner, Notes Search, Algorithm Info).
    - To run campus navigator, select a start and end building and click on a algorithm. Observe results.
    - To run the study planner, enter task with associated time and value. Set an available time, run Greedy or DP and observe results.
    - To run the notes search, enter text into the textbox or load a file (PDF, DOCX, TXT). Enter a pattern in the field, select the search algorithm and obeserve the results. 
    - The Algorithm Info Page simply gives insight into Algorithm Info & Complexities and P vs NP.
