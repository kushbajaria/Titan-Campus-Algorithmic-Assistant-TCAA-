# The Titan Campus Algorithmic Assistant (TCAA) is a comprehensive, hands-on final project designed to integrate the full range of algorithmic and data-structure concepts covered in CPSC 335. You will apply your knowledge by building a fully interactive Python GUI application that performs real-world problem solving across graph algorithms, dynamic programming, greedy strategies, and advanced string-matching algorithms. This project reinforces theoretical understanding through practical implementation while strengthening the your ability to design, analyze, and present algorithmic solutions.
